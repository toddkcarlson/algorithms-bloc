1) Seven

2) Two

3)

fib(2) = 0 + 1 = 1
fib(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5
fib(6) = 8
fib(7) = 13
fib(8) = 21
fib(9) = 34
fib(10) = 55
fib(11) = 89
fib(12) = 144

1) Linear because binary only works on a sorted array. Recursive because it requires less code.

2) Binary because it's worse case performance, O(log n), is better than linear's O(n). Iterative, because of performance as well.
