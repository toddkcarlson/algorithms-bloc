1) An algorithm that has O(1) is a race car and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a wagon.
2) The best case scenario for binary search is when the first element tried is the matching element.
3) The worse case scenario for binary search is when the last element tried is the matching element.
4) The bounded-case case scenario for binary search is when the matching element is found between the first and last possible element.
